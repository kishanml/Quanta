# Quanta

Quanta is a website developed for a client who is an algorithmic trader. The client requested a platform to provide daily market insights and allow users to subscribe to different pricing plans. The website features three subscription packages: **Basic**, **Professional**, and **Advanced**. Each package provides tailored services based on the chosen plan.

## Key Features:
- **Subscription Packages:** Users can choose from three plans (Basic, Professional, and Advanced) to access market insights.

- **Telegram Group Access:** After confirming the subscription, the owner sends the user a link to a Telegram group where market insights are shared.
